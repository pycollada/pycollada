This example illustrates how to visualize COLLADA model using
OpenGL. As a Python wrapper for OpenGL API the pyglet library
(http://www.pyglet.org/) is used. So, please make sure to install
pyglet before trying this example. The simplest way to do it is to run
'easy_install pyglet'.

There are two renderers implemented:
* OldStyleRenderer which uses now depricated display lists to draw the
  model.
* GLSLRenderer which uses OpenGL shaders and VBOs.

By default, this example uses OldStyleRenderer because it produces
more correct results. Also, the code is quite streight forward and
should be easy to understand.

In contrast, GLSLRenderer should be much faster and is the way to go
with modern OpenGL API. However, most probably because of bug in our
shaders code, there are some visualization artifacts when using
GLSLRenderer. Also, for some reasons which I do not understand yet,
there is an error while using OldStyleRenderer on my Asus UX32V
notebook running Debian SID. GLSRendere works fine. So please feel
free to experiment and find out which one works for you.

To switch between two renderes, just comment/uncomment corresponding
code at line 63-64 in daeview.py. For example, to use GLSLRenderer:
  daerender = renderer.GLSLRenderer(collada_file)
  #daerender = renderer.OldStyleRenderer(collada_file, window)

To run the example, simply execute daeview.py <dae_file_name>. There
are some models to test in the data/ directory. If started without
parameters, cockpit.zip will be displayed.

This example is not intendent to be complete DAE viewer and might fail
to display some files. The main purpose of this example is to help
understand how to get access to the important information and traverse
the data structures created by pycollada after parsing certain dae
file.
