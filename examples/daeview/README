This example illustrates how to visualize COLLADA model using
OpenGL. As a Python wrapper for OpenGL API the pyglet library
(http://www.pyglet.org/) is used. Please see some more details
regarding pyglet in the requirements.txt file.

There are two renderers implemented:
* GLSLRenderer which uses OpenGL shaders and VBOs.
* OldStyleRenderer which uses now deprecated display lists to draw the
  model.

By default, this example uses GLSLRenderer which is fast and is the
way to go with modern OpenGL API. However, most probably because of
bug in our shaders code, there are some visualization artifacts when
using GLSLRenderer.

In contrast, OldStyleRenderer is slower but it produces more correct
results. Also, the code is quite straight forward and should be easy
to understand. OldStyleRenderer works fine on Windows but throws error
on Linux and OSX. So please feel free to experiment and find out which
one works for you.

To switch between two renderers, just comment/uncomment corresponding
code at line 64-65 in daeview.py. For example, to use
OldStyleRenderer:
  #daerender = renderer.GLSLRenderer(collada_file)
  daerender = renderer.OldStyleRenderer(collada_file, window)

To run the example, simply execute daeview.py <dae_file_name>. There
are some models to test in the data/ directory. If started without
parameters, cockpit.zip will be displayed.

This example is not intended to be complete DAE viewer and might fail
to display some files. The main purpose of this example is to help
understand how to get access to the important information and traverse
the data structures created by pycollada after parsing certain dae
file.
