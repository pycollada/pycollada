# pycollada

pycollada is a python module for creating, editing and loading
[COLLADA](https://www.khronos.org/collada/), which is a COLLAborative Design Activity
for establishing an interchange file format for interactive 3D applications.

The library allows you to load a COLLADA file and interact with it as a python
object. In addition, it supports creating a collada python object from scratch,
as well as in-place editing.

You can get help at the [pycollada mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/pycollada).

See the [pycollada Documentation](http://pycollada.readthedocs.org/) for more
information.
